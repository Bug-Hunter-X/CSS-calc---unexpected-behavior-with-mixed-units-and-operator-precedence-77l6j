The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit compatibility.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20%);` might not produce what you expect because you're subtracting a percentage from a percentage without a clear reference point. Similarly, mixing different units without proper conversion can also cause errors, such as `height: calc(100px + 5em);` where the browser might struggle to reconcile pixels and ems.
